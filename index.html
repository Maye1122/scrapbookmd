				<h4 id="verbs-pp">Verbs Past participle</h4>
				<p>
					In grammar, the past participle of a verb is a form
					that is usually the same as the past form and so ends in '-ed'.
					A number of verbs have irregular past participles, for example ' break'
					(past participle 'broken'), and ' come' (past participle 'come').
					Past participles are used to form perfect tenses and the passive voice,
					and many of them can be used like an adjective in front of a noun. </p>

				<h4 id="phrasal-verbs">Phrasal Verbs</h4>
				<p>
				<p>You use phrasal verbs daily while speaking.
					A phrasal verb is actually a verb made up of two or more
					words: the main verb with an adverb or preposition, or both.
					Using these words in combination gives them a meaning
					different from that of the individual words used.
					This makes them difficult for non-native English
					speakers to understand.</p>

		Comparatives and superlatives are special types of adjectives used when

		and superlatives is making sure we are writing them the correct way, 
		but with a little practice, comparatives and superlatives can quickly be mastered.
		 <h5>Comparative with 2 things </h5>
		 <ul>
			<li>A is smaller than B</li>
		 <li>A is more expensive than B</li>
		 <li>A is more farther than B</li></ul>
		 <ul>
			<li>big = bigger</li>
			<li>Spicy = spicier</li>
		 </ul>
		
		 <h5>Superlative with 3 things</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>C is the most expensive</li>
			<li>	C is the farthest</li>
			<li>C is the closest</li>
			<li>C is the lowest</li>

		<h5>With irregular </h5>

			<li>good, better, best</li>
